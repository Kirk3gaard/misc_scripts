	Indicates connections between scaffolds and produces network 
	files for an easy visualization 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

cytoscapeviz.pl  -i [-o -e -m -f -a -s] : version 1.0

 [-help -h]           Displays this basic usage information
 [-infile -i]         SAM format infile
 [-outcon -o]         Connections file (default: network.txt)
 [-enddist -e]        Reads must hit within this distance of the end to be considered an end hit (default: 500)
 [-minlength -m]      The minimum length of a contig to infer closed circle (default: 3000)
 [-minconnections -f] The minimum number of connections to print the connection to the outfile (default: 10)
 [-avgreadlength -a]  The average readlength of the reads used to estimate read position (default: 125)
 [-headersplit -s]    The symbol used to split the header to make the read 1 and 2 headers identical (default: _)
